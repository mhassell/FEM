Finite elements for elliptic equations in 2D

TBD: Because of the memory management by new-ing and delete-ing within the triangulation object, the "rule of three" indicates that I also need a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator for this class as well.  I don't think I'll need these in the code per se, but I will add them to learn these and mainatain best practices.
